# Energy-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a Python script for building and evaluating models to predict energy demand based on historical data.

## Overview

1. **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset including data summary, visualization of key features, and data cleaning.
2. **Feature Selection:** Selecting relevant features for modeling and preparing the data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing the dataset and exploring relationships between variables.
4. **Modeling:** Building various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The notebook also includes PCA-based models.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).


To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
